# dynamicstudio GmbH docs - SSOT

Welcome the dynamicstudio GmbH's own documentation site.

This is intended to be the single source of truth for both internal guidelines,
best practices, api usage and so on.

At dynamicstudio we strive to be as open and clear as possible.
For that reason these docs is written in english and is publicly available for everyone to enjoy.

If you find any errors or want to contribute feel free to make a PR.

Thank you,

Roberto Cabassi Bombardieri

Team dynamicstudio
